    <h3>Breakfast Sausage and Kale Dutch Baby</h3>
    <p>This miniature version of toad in a the hole features small adorable breakfast sausages.</p>
    <p>I also added kale to the 'breakfast pool' our little tadpoles will be swimming in which will make this more nutritious (and delicious).</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small bunch stemmed kale</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 cooked breakfast sausage links</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a pot of lightly salted water over high heat and bring to a brisk boil. Add kale and boil until leaves just start to get tender, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place kale into a bowl of cold water, then drain. Gently squeeze out as much excess water as possible and roughly chop kale; set kale aside. You will need about 1/2 cup of chopped kale. </li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook sausage links until browned, 2 minutes per side. Remove from skillet. </li>
        <li>Use butter and fat from cooking to grease two 9-ounce baking dishes. </li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, eggs, maple syrup, salt, pepper, and cayenne in a bowl. Whisk until flour disappears. Pour in milk and whisk to combine. Stir in about 1/2 cup chopped kale and mix in with a fork. </li>
        <li>Ladle mixture into prepared baking dishes - the depth of the batter needs to be about 1/2 inch deep. Place sausage links on top of the mixture. </li>
        <li>Place dishes in the center of a cold oven. Turn heat to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) and leave in for about 25 minutes. Remove and serve. </li>
    </ol>
